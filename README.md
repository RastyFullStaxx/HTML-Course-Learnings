# HTML-Course-Learnings

This repository holds my files for my own records of programming course in HTML, containing practices named in an orderly fashion.


### Lesson #1: Basics

To start creating an HTML file:
- Input the header `<!DOCTYPE html>` on the first line.
- HTML is about opening and closing tags. After the header, input the opening `<html>` tag together with its closing tag `</html>`. Inside this, you can now proceed to add the content of your HTML by inserting it within the tags.
