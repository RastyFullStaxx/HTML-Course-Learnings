# HTML-Course-Learnings

This repository holds my files for my own records of programming course in HTML, containing practices named in an orderly fashion.

### Lesson #1: Basics

To start creating an HTML file:
- Input the header **`<!DOCTYPE html>`** on the first line.
- HTML is about opening and closing tags. After the header, input the opening `**<html>**` tag together with its closing tag `**</html>**`. Inside this, you can now proceed to add the content of your HTML by inserting it within the tags.

#### Headers

Headers need opening (`**<head>**`) and closing (`**</head>**`) tags as well.
Inside these tags, we can insert a variety of content, but generally, it's the space for the title of your website. Of course, it does needs tags as well. 
- `**<title>**`
- `**</title>**`

The file cannot run yet. Apart from the head, we need the body tag. 
- `**<body>**`
- `**</body>**`

Inside this, we begin inserting our contents such as texts, images and videos.
For texts, we can set varrying sizes for them. header 1`<h1>``</h1>` as the largest and header 6 the smallest

note: to write a comment, we use `**<!-- ur comments here -->**`

we can now run the code. It will look like this
