# HTML-Course-Learnings

This repository holds my files for my own records of programming course in HTML, containing practices named in an orderly fashion.

### Lesson #1: Basics

To start creating an HTML file:
- Input the header **`<!DOCTYPE html>`** on the first line.
- HTML is about opening and closing tags. After the header, input the opening **`<html>`** tag together with its closing tag **`</html>`**. Inside this, you can now proceed to add the content of your HTML by inserting it within the tags.

#### Headers

Headers need opening **(`<head>`)** and closing **(`</head>`)** tags as well.
Inside these tags, we can insert a variety of content, but generally, it's the space for the title of your website. Of course, it does needs tags as well. 
- **`<title>`**
- **`</title>`**

The file cannot run yet. Apart from the head, we need the body tag. 
- **`<body>`**
- **`</body>`**

Inside this, we begin inserting our contents such as texts, images and videos.
For texts, we can set varrying sizes for them. header 1: opening**`<h1>`**; closing**`</h1>`** as the largest, and header 6 the smallest

note: to write a comment, we use **`<!-- ur comments here -->`**

we can now run the code. It will look like this

To bread or add space between the lines, we use the line break function tag. This one do not need a close tag
- **`<br>`**

To add a horizontal line, we use this function that do not need a close tag as well.
- **`<hr`**

To create a paragraph, use the tags
- `<p>`
- `</p>`

Finally, to generate a readily-available paragraph content. just type **lorem** and if you're using vs code, just hit enter
