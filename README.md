# HTML-Course-Learnings

This repository holds my files for my own records of programming course in HTML, containing practices named in an orderly fashion.

### Lesson #1: Basics

To start creating an HTML file:
- Input the header `<!DOCTYPE html>` on the first line.
- HTML is about opening and closing tags. After the header, input the opening `<html>` tag together with its closing tag `</html>`. Inside this, you can now proceed to add the content of your HTML by inserting it within the tags.

#### Headers

Headers need opening (`<head>`) and closing (`</head>`) tags as well.
Inside these tags, we can insert a variety of content, but generally, it's the space for the title of your website. Of course, it does needs tags as well. 
- `<title>` and;
- `</title>`

The file cannot run yet. Apart from the head, we need the body tag. 
- `<body>`
- `</body>`
